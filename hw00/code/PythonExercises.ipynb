To use `venv` (to manage the environment) and `pip` (to install packages) please see this [quick guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments). You can first create a folder named \"itcs4101\\\" for the course, inside which you will place all your homework assignment folders. A prototypical setup in a Unix-based system looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *mkdir itcs4101* # this creates the course folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *cd itcs4101* # this changes the current directory to that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *python3 -m venv .venvnlp* # this creates the virtual environment named 'venlp' (you can use any name you want).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *source .venvnlp/bin/activate* # this activates the virtual environment 'venvnlp'. After this, anything you isntall with pip will be installed in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip* # this installs the 'pip' package manager.\n",
